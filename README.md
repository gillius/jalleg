jalleg - JVM Binding for Allegro
================================

* Inception: May 2016
* Current Version: 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
* No releases yet, but snapshots on OSSRH (see [Getting Started](#getting-started))

jalleg is a JVM binding for [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/) 5.2 to be used by any
[JVM language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages)
(Java obviously, but also other languages such as Groovy, Kotlin, JavaScript, Scala, Jython, JRuby, and Clojure).

(Note: JavaScript on JVM does not mean it can run in a browser. If you want a true JS port of Allegro, check out
[Allegro.js](http://allegrojs.net/))

This project was inspired to build a modern version of a very old project,
[JAllegro](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jallegro/) by Kazzmir.

The binding is based on the [JNA library](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) to bind to the pre-built Allegro
DLL/so library. The bindings were generated in part from the [JNAerator](http://jnaerator.googlecode.com/) project, then
manipulated to fit the needs and style for jalleg.

Allegro was a library I originally worked with a lot when I was learning C/C++ development in DOS in the late 1990s, and
has always had a special meaning to me. Allegro 5 is a modern, cross-platform variation of the library supporting hardware
rendering and even mobile development. Allegro is a simple library to use and programming a game is a great way to get
into learning programming. My hope is that jalleg expands the Allegro fun to Java and all the JVM languages.

Features / Status
-----------------

Besides the direct binding, jalleg provides a framework around Allegro with the following currently implemented features:
* Automatically unpack and load Allegro DLL for you (Win64 only currently)
* Basic game loop / initialization
* Statistics tracking (rendered frames/sec, logic frames/etc, percentage idle time, etc.)
* Ability to load Allegro resources and create memfiles from JARs and Java byte arrays
* "Retro" audio system capable of generating and playing square, triangle, sawtooth, sine waves or user-defined waveforms

### How you can help

The main thing I need help with is pre-built Linux "portable" (i.e. static linked) versions of Allegro to include in the
auto-loader. It also would be nice if someone can demonstrate that jalleg can work on Android as I suspect it should.

I also currently do not know how to bind to varargs methods when using the "Direct Method Optimization" mode of JNA. A
few methods like al_draw_textf are not available. However, Java has String.format you can use to do a printf-style
formatting and pass into al_draw_text and similar methods.

### Binding Status

I first started out auto-generating all of the core API. The auto-generation works but does not pick the most ideal Java
types for use and in some cases just uses "Pointer" type instead of String or ALLEGRO_BITMAP for example. So I've been
going through and fixing up the API. Anything not marked as "hand-tuned" is definitely subject to change.

The priority will be on APIs that don't already exist in Java. For example in Java there is not much use for a Unicode
strings API since that is already native to Java. Likewise for files, path handling, threads, etc. If developing with
jalleg, I suggest using Java-provided features where possible.

* Core API
  * Configuration files   - :+1: hand-tuned (plus convenience API in framework)
  * Displays              - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Events                - :+1: hand-tuned
  * File I/O              - :+1: hand-tuned (but missing *fprintf due to varargs)
  * Filesystem            - hand-tuned (not tested yet). No solution yet for time_t and off_t functions due to size
                            differences between platforms. This also impacts the ability to
                            use ALLEGRO_FS_INTERFACE. Use native Java functionality where possible.
  * Fixed point math      - No plans to port -- most calls are macros anyway; could be easily re-implemented in Java.
  * Fullscreen modes      - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Graphics routines     - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Haptic routines       - :+1: hand-tuned (note this is an ALLEGRO_UNSTABLE API)
  * Joystick routines     - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Keyboard routines     - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Memory management     - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Monitors              - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Mouse routines        - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Path structures       - hand-tuned (not tested yet) (suggest Java native)
  * Shader                - hand-tuned (not tested yet)
  * State                 - :+1: hand-tuned
  * System routines       - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Threads               - hand-tuned (not tested yet) (**highly** suggest Java native threads)
  * Time                  - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Timer                 - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Touch input           - hand-tuned (not tested yet)
  * Transformations       - :+1: hand-tuned
  * UTF-8 string routines - hand-tuned (not tested yet) (varargs methods missing) (**highly** suggest Java String)
  * Miscellaneous         - need to determine if al_run_main is needed
  * Platform-specific     - cannot implement these yet, may find workaround for Android methods if someone tries jalleg there
  * Direct3D integration  - no current plan to implement unless a D3D Java binding is found and use case
  * OpenGL integration    - no current plan to implement unless there is a use case

* Addons
  * Audio addon           - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Audio codecs          - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Color addon           - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Font addons           - :+1: hand-tuned (varargs methods missing)
  * Image I/O addon       - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Main addon            - n/a
  * Memfile addon         - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Native dialogs addon  - hand-tuned binding, but without al_build_menu (consider Java native for file chooser)
  * PhysicsFS addon       - :+1: hand-tuned
  * Primitives addon      - :+1: hand-tuned


Getting Started
---------------

There are 4 libraries built by the project:

1. **jalleg-binding:** Contains the JNA-based bindings themselves to load and use the Allegro library.
2. **jalleg-rt-x86-64:** Optional, contains within a Windows 64-bit pre-built Allegro DLL. If this JAR is included in your
   project, JNA will automatically unpack the DLL and use it when on Windows. Other OS may be added in the future.
3. **jalleg-framework:** framework to make using the binding from Java easier and to support the examples.
4. **jalleg-examples:** An example project using jalleg-binding and jalleg-rt.

jalleg comes with a pre-built runtime for Java 64 bit on Windows. If you want to run jalleg on Ubuntu, the easiest way
is to [install from the PPA](https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Install_Allegro_from_Ubuntu_PPAs). JAlleg will
search for liballegro.so automatically on the normal ldpaths. If you build
Allegro yourself (use WANT_MONOLITH), set AL_NAME environment variable, an example being:
`export AL_NAME=/home/me/allegro/build/lib/liballegro_monolith.so.5.2`, then run jalleg as normal. You can also pass in
AL_NAME like `java -DAL_NAME=the_path MyProgram` or `./gradlew -PAL_NAME=the_path`

Since there is no release version yet, you can get the latest 0.1-SNAPSHOT via the OSSRH repository:

Maven:
```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>ossrh</id>
    <name>OSSRH Snapshots</name>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

Or in Gradle:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
    }
}
```

Then you can add dependency on the snapshot:

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.gillius</groupId>
  <artifactId>jalleg-framework</artifactId>
  <version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'org.gillius:jalleg-framework:0.1-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

If you just want to see an example, download the [examples application](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.gillius&a=jalleg-examples&v=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&e=zip).
Running the bat file there will run the example [described later](#examples).

Building
--------

Building is quite easy as you need only Java 7+ installed and on your path, and a connection to the Internet. The
project is built with [Gradle](http://gradle.org/). Gradle is capable of downloading itself and all dependencies needed
to build the project.

Simply get the source code and run `gradlew build` in Windows or `sh gradlew build` for Unix-like shells such as BASH.
If you've cloned from git or run `chmod u+x gradlew` then you can just use `./gradlew` in Unix-like systems. Gradle
invocation examples from onward will use `gradlew` as example, but replace with `sh gradlew` or `./gradlew` as
appropriate.

If you want to run the example "ball and paddle" game:

```
gradlew run
```

Documentation
-------------

The binding is a straight port of the Allegro library. Use the
[official Allegro documentation](http://liballeg.org/a5docs/5.2.0/).

I have started a small tutorial on using [jalleg for new Java developers](https://github.com/gillius/jalleg/wiki/Allegro-for-new-Java-developers),
initially aimed at those who have prior programming experience (such as those using Allegro in C).

Another good place to go for help is the [Allegro.cc](https://www.allegro.cc/) community, one of the most supportive
communities I've ever seen on the Internet and a great help and inspiration to my own learning when I started many
years ago.

Examples
--------

Here is a very simple example showing how to open a display and clear it to a color:

```java
import static org.gillius.jalleg.binding.AllegroLibrary.*;

/**
 * Displays a 640x480 red window for 1 second.
 */
public class HelloAllegro {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		al_install_system(ALLEGRO_VERSION_INT, null);

		ALLEGRO_DISPLAY display = al_create_display(640, 480);

		al_clear_to_color(al_map_rgb_f(1f, 0f, 0f));
		al_flip_display();
		Thread.sleep(1000);

		al_destroy_display(display);

		al_uninstall_system();
	}
}
```

A more complicated example can be found for a ball and paddle game, there are two forms, one
[using only Allegro API](https://github.com/gillius/jalleg/blob/master/jalleg-examples/src/main/java/org/gillius/jalleg/example/BallAndPaddleGameSingleFile.java)
and another
[using jalleg-framework](https://github.com/gillius/jalleg/blob/master/jalleg-examples/src/main/java/org/gillius/jalleg/example/BallAndPaddleGame.java)
and having some more features. The game uses A and Z to control the left player and up and down arrows to control the
right player. In the jalleg-framework version, joystick control is supported for the right player and mouse control
works for both players by clicking and holding where you want the paddle to be. The framework version also has sound
effects through generating square waves and rumble effects on the joystick if supported when ball collides with the
right paddle.
